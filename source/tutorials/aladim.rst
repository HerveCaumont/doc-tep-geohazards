**ALADIM**

This service is developped by CNRS-EOST (Strasbourg, France). It allows to detect and map new landslides triggered by large forcing events (earthquake, heavy rains) from the analysis of pre- and post-event imagery, and is based on change detection methods. It allows the processing of High Resolution multispectral data (ALADIM-S2; Sentinel-2 SAFE files) and Very-High Resolution multispectral data (ALADIM-VHR; typically Pl√©iades and Spot 6/7). The set of pre- and post-image should be accurately co-registered in order to use the service. A training dataset of manually mapped landslides (by digitalization), the extent of the training areas, and the extent of the region of interest (ROI) should be provided as inputs (shape file-format) by the user. The outputs consist in a database of landslide polygons than can be assimilated to an Earth-Observation derived landslide inventory. ALADIM builds on the change detection methodology partially described in Stumpf et al. [2011](#Stumpf2011) and in Stumpf et al. [2014](#Stumpf2014).
