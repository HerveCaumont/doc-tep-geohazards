A Community Portal
==================


The portal homepage gives the user quick access to recent community inputs: 
	- up-to-date social feeds (twitter, rss, tumblr posts, ...), 
	- featured stories related to geohazards,
	- last shared achievements.

Thus, users are kept up to date with last news or products from the geohazards community.

The portal is also meant to give the user the ability to easily share its work with the community and give other users access to its results.
