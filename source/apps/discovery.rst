Thematic apps can be searched using filters defined by the user, such as:

	- **Free text**: search within title and description of the thematic app
	- **Start date**: search for apps created or updated after a given date
	- **End date**: search for apps created or updated before a given date
	- **AOI**: search for apps related to a certain area

The search is performed amongst thematic apps which are accessible to the current user.

All users also have an application dedicated to the management of all items they owns (see :ref:`app_workspace`).
It is call **My worskpace** and will give to the user the ability to manage (edit / share / delete) all items he owns amongst WPS services, data collections, data packages, WPS jobs.

From this "workspace", users can also manage (create / edit / delete) their own *Thematic App* (see :ref:`app_workspace`).
